# FLSE
Live Demo: [FLSE](https://stella.hs.vc/flse/testpage.html)

## Get Started
### Adding remotely
Get Started by adding this to the bottom of your HTML document.

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stel-la/flse@1.0/flse-1.0.min.js"></script>
Then you can use `<flsemobilehide>` to hide objects on mobile and `<flsemobileonly>` to show objects on mobile only.
### Adding locally
Download the latest release of FLSE and place it somewhere such as /js/flse and link it as a script in your HTML document. In this case we stored FLSE at /js/flse/flse.js, so our script would look like this:
```
<script src="/js/flse/flse.js"></script> 
```
Please note that storing FLSE locally means you won't always have the latest version and therefore features, so we recommend you update your FLSE file every so often.
Head over to the Wiki to learn about more features.
